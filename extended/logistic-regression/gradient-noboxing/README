The gradient operation in Logistic regression program written in Java.
The code is written to SHADOW the behaviour of compiled Scala code, except that
it does not include the BOX/UNBOX part. It still has the cost of memory
allocation for Spark map and reduce operations due to immutability of the data. 

Usage:
  Gradient
        <Int dimension>
        <Int iteration_num>
        <Float sample_num in million>

Makefile options:
    $ make                to build
    $ make run            to run the example 
    $ make run-par        to run parallel examples one tied to each core 
    $ make clean          clean generated .class files
