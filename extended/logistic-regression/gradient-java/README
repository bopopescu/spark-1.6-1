The gradient operation in Logistic regression program written in Java.

The -XX:CompileThreshold option directly passedto java during runtime is used
to control the level of JIT compilation.  The Makefile shows how to set the
options.  The default value for threshold seems to be 1; if a method is called
one time then it is JIT compiled.  Threshold 1 means compile everything and
threshold 0 means compile nothing.  

Usage:
  Gradient
        <Int dimension>
        <Int iteration_num>
        <Float sample_num in million>

Makefile options:
    $ make                to build
    $ make run            to run the example with default JIT threshold 
    $ make run-par        to run parallel examples one tied to each core 
    $ make run-nojit      to run the example with JIT disabled
    $ make run-alljit     to run the example with JIT enabled for any method
    $ make clean          clean generated .class files
