The gradient operation in Logistic regression program written in Java.
The code is written to SHADOW the behaviour of compiled Scala code. It has the
cost of box/unbox for map and zip operators for vector computations and map and
reduce Spark operators. It also has the cost of memory allocation for
intermediate data for map and reduce Spark operations, due to immutability of
data in Spark. 

Usage:
  Gradient
        <Int dimension>
        <Int iteration_num>
        <Float sample_num in million>

Makefile options:
    $ make                to build
    $ make run            to run the example 
    $ make run-par        to run parallel examples one tied to each core 
    $ make clean          clean generated .class files
