Stencil 1D program written under Spark. The bandwidth of the the stencil is
assumed to be 1. It uses the flatMap, groupByKey, and map operations to
implement the ghost value data exchange necessary for the stencil. However,
there is no operation happening to apply the stencil. Instead if you want to
fake some operation time, use non zero spin_wait argument.

After launching master and slaves use the spark-submit script as follows:
  
../../bin/spark-submit
      --conf spark.eventLog.enabled=true
      --conf spark.eventLog.dir=../../log-dir
      --class LogisticRegression
      --master spark://<master-url>:7077
      --deploy-mode client
      --executor-memory 4g
      target/scala-2.10/stencil-1d_2.10-1.0.jar
        <Int iteration_num>
        <Int partition_num>
        <Int partition_size>
        <Int spin_wait in micro seconds>

Makefile options:
    $ make                to build
    $ make start          start a master and slave locally
    $ make stop           stop master and slave locally
    $ make run            to run an example againt local master and slave
    $ make run-events     activate event logging as well
    $ make clean          clean generated binary
    $ make clean-all      clean generated binary and also log directories
